# Cowid 24: Flatten the Curve :cow2:

You're the only one who can save our livestock by containing the Cowid 24 epidemic.  The aim of the
game is simple: to keep the contamination rate below the target while a vaccine is being produced.

To do this, you can move contaminated cows into quarantine so that they don't contaminate the rest 
of the herd. Be careful however, as the situation can easily turn into a complete chaos !

**Controls** : Simply drag and drop the cows

Cows that fart are sick and will contaminate the rest of the herd. Beware, however: healthy cows
that are contaminated will remain infectious but symptom-free before they start farting themselves.
